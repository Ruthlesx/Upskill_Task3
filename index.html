      Semantic elements are elements that clearly describe its meaning in a human and machine readable way,They are tags that define the meaning bof the content they contain.
      examples: "header","form","section","article","footer" <br/>

        <br/>while
        Non semantic elements are elements that do not define the content of their elements, they tell nothing about its content.
        examples: "div", "span"

       Closing tags are used to wrap content and denote the beginning and end of an element. 
       while Self closing tags are used for elements that don't have any content inside them. They don't require a seperate closing tag because they don't enclose any content.   
    </article>

    <p>
      Inline elements are those elements that don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. examples are: "span", "a", "strong" .<br/>
       
      while 
      Block elements are elements that start on a new line and take up the full width availabile. Examples are: "div", "p", "ul", "li".
